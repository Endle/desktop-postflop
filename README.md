# Desktop Postflop

**Desktop Postflop** is a free, open-source GTO solver for Texas hold'em poker.

This is a port of [WASM Postflop] to native desktop applications using the [Tauri] framework.
Since WASM Postflop works on web browsers, it is more suitable for casual use.
However, if you want to use the solver for more serious purposes, please consider installing Desktop Postflop.
